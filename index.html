			<h2>Python - a simple yet powerful language</h2>
			<p>Accoridng to TIOBE index, Python is the 4th most popular language. Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks.</p>
		
			<h3>Easy to Understand</h3>
			<p>The simple syntax rules of the programming language makes it easy for beginners to keep the code readable and application maintainable. Python supports object oriented and structured programming and also support various concepts in functional and aspect-oriented programming. The programming paradigms and language features ease the process of developing large and complex software applications.</p>
		
			<h3>Open Source</h3>
			<p>As an open source programming language, Python helps curtail software development cost significantly. You can use several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools to curtail development time without increasing development cost. You even have option to choose from a wide range of open source Python frameworks and development tools according to your precise needs.</p>
			
			<h3>Flexibility</h3>
			<p>As a dynamically typed language, Python is really flexible. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, Python is forgiving of errors so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part...</p>
			
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>Atlhough Python is easy to use, forgiving in errors, and has all the libraries you can imagine, it does have some limitations. As an interpreted language, it is slower than other langugages &#40;Java,C&#35;&#41; and it's not well supported for mobile development.</p>
			
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Pyhthon is a language you should be learning. It's a simple, approachable, versatile and complete language thats chosen by the best companies such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. It's a fast growing language and loved by developers. Python is not a perfect fit for all projects but it is a good choice for many cases.</p>

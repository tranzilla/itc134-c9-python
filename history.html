			<h2>Python - A Historical Primer</h2>
			<p>Python was born as a programming language the same year that Taylor Swift was born. The year was 1989. This makes Python older than Java, R, Javascript and Ariana Grande (Wood pars. 1-2).</p>
			<p>There was a man named Guido van Rossum who was responsible for all this. It all started however, as an innocuous hobby. He did not name it after the famous snake, the reticulated python. He named it after Monty Python, as he was a fan of the British mode of slapstick comedy (Wood par. 2)</p>
			<p>Python become a very popular language because of its ability to utilize different coding libraries and file formats (Wood par. 4). </p>
			<p>Python is a good language for a coding novice like Tran. For instance, Python 2.0 became more open source so that more people could work on it or fix bugs. Python 3 simplified the whole structure of the language and was a controversial overhaul, as it was not backwards compatible (Wood pars 6 - 8).</p>
